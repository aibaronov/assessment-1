// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

//1. Planning
//2. Analysis of Requirements
//3. Design
//4. Implementation
//5. Testing and Integration
//6. Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "During this step, the developer must evaluate which software systems are currently in place and decide on features to add. The goal and needs of the user must be defined."

const analysisOfRequirements = "This step is also part of the planning step. During this step, the developer must determine the desired functionality of the application and the features that it's required to have."

const design = "During this step, the developer can create a 'Prototype' of the software. The prototype will give a summary of appearance of the application and how it will work. In general, this step will create a model for how the software will work."

const implementation = "This is the where the program is written. Depending on the size of the project, this may be done by either a single developer or a group of developers."

const testingAndIntegration = "During testing, a check is performed to make sure that each function of the program works properly. Also, different portions of the program must be checked to make sure that they work smoothly with one another. This phase helps reduce the number of bugs and glitches that may be encountered during release."

const maintain = "During this phase, the developers respond to any bugs discovered by users. The developer must then provide bug fixes. Also, the developer can plan for new features in later versions of the software."
